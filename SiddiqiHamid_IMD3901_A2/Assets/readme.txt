Overview of What I did:

For this project, I chose to create a shooting game for both desktop and HMD control players. 
You're on a planet, and the goal of the game is for the player to collect bullets to shoot at UFOs, 
which would destroy them. I chose this design because I am someone who loves shooting games, which I 
played on my iPad when I was younger. I also felt I could have lots of fun with adding different sound effects,
such as when a player pulls a trigger, collects a bullet, and shoots when there are no bullets collected. 
At the beginning of the game, you can choose to play with desktop control by pressing 1 or HMD control by pressing 2. For controls 
on desktop, the player moves around using WASD controls and shoots by pressing the spacebar. You would use your mouse as your camera to look 
around, help find bullets, and you would use the crosshair target to help aim your shots towards the UFOs. For HMD control, it follows 
the same controls you would use on VR, such as IJKL to move around. The only difference with HMD control from the desktop is that to shoot, 
you would left-mouse click.

What was Challenging:

What I mainly found challenging was getting used to the HMD controls and being able to get my VR player to 
collect bullets on the HMD controls. I found that referencing my desktop player controller code for getting my 
VR player to collect bullets was able to help with the issues that I had. Another challenge I had was figuring 
out how I could get my players to choose which controller they wanted to play the game with. What helped me was 
breaking down the steps in the script for writing when to enable either the Desktop controller or the HMD controller.

What went well:

What I found worked well was adding and implementing all the audio I used, such as sound effects and music. I found 
adding sound effects such as collecting bullets, pulling the trigger, a gun being empty, and a yay sound when winning 
would add great interaction to the game, along with the music on loop. What I also found went well was being able to 
spawn new bullets. When you shoot a bullet, two new bullets are created near the player for them to go collect more bullets, 
which is tracked by a UI text which shows the number of bullets that were collected.
